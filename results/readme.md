* in the file critpolys.json the data is formatted as

* curve: factorization over QQ of the critical polynomial of that curve 

* When the level is square free. The critpoly is defined by
    $\prod_{z : f_E(z) = 0 }(x - j(z))$.

* When the level is not square free. The critpoly is defined by
    $\prod_{z : f_E(z) = 0 }(x - u(z))$
Where u is a rational function on $X_0(N)$, not necessarily the j-invariant.

For curve = 664a1, $l = EtaProduct(8,{8:8,2:4,4:-12})^{-1}$. 

For curve = 944e1, $l = EtaProduct(16,{8:-6,4:2,16:4})^{-1}$.
